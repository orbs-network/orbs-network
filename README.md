# Orbs Network

Orbs is a public blockchain infrastructure built for the needs of decentralized apps with millions of users. For more information, please check https://orbs.com and read the [white papers](https://orbs.com/white-papers).

This repo contains the node core reference implementation in golang.

The project is thoroughly tested with unit tests, component tests per microservice, acceptance tests, E2E tests and E2E stress tests running the system under load.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

* Make sure [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) is installed (version 1.10 or later).
  
  > Verify with `go version`

* Make sure [Go workspace bin](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42965673/cant-run-go-bin-in-terminal) is in your path.
  
  > Install with ``export PATH=$PATH:`go env GOPATH`/bin``
  
  > Verify with `echo $PATH`

* Make sure Git is installed (version 2 or later).

  > Verify with `git --version`

### Build

* Clone the repo to your Go workspace:
```
cd `go env GOPATH`
go get github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go
cd src/github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go
git checkout master // or dev if you want the dev branch
```

* Install dependencies with `go get -t ./...`

* Build with `go install`

### Run

* To run the pre-built binary (should be in path):
```
orbs-network-go
```

* To rebuild from source and run (this will take you to project root):
```
cd `go env GOPATH`
cd src/github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go
go run *.go
```

## Testing from command line

### Prerequisites for tests

* Make sure [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#getting-ginkgo) is installed.
  
  > Install with `go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`
  
  > Verify with `ginkgo version`

### Available test runners

* The custom ginkgo test runner `ginkgo` (tailored to the testing framework we use)

* The official go test runner `go test` (has minimal UI and result caching)

### Test

* Run **all** tests from project root:
 
  * Using ginkgo test runner with `ginkgo ./...`
  * Using go test with `go test ./...`

* Run only **fast** tests (no E2E and similar):
  
  * Using go test with `go test -short ./...`
  
* Check unit test coverage:

  * Using go test with ``go test -cover `go list ./...` ``

### Test types

* Slow tests:

  ##### E2E tests

  > End-to-end tests check the entire system in a real life scenario mimicking real production with multiple nodes. It runs on docker with several nodes connected in a cluster. Due to their nature, E2E tests are slow to run.

  * The tests are found in [`/test/e2e`](test/e2e)
  * Run the suite from project root with `ginkgo -v ./test/e2e` or `go test ./test/e2e`
  
  ##### Integration tests
  
  > Integration tests check the system adapters and make sure they meet the interface contract they implement. For example connection to a database or network sockets.

  * The tests are found per adapter (per service), eg. [`/services/gossip/adapter`](/services/gossip/adapter)

* Fast tests:

  ##### Acceptance tests

  > Acceptance tests check the internal hexagon of the system (it's logic with all microservices) with faster adapters that allow the suite to run extremely fast.  

  * The tests are found in [`/test/acceptance`](test/acceptance)
  * Run the suite from project root with `ginkgo -v ./test/acceptance` or `go test ./test/acceptance`

  ##### Component tests

  > Component tests check that a single service meets its specification while mocking the other services around it. They allow development of a service in isolation. 

  * The tests are found per service in the `test` directory, eg. [`/services/transactionpool/test`](/services/transactionpool/test)

  ##### Unit tests
  
  > Unit tests are very specific tests that check a single unit or two. They test the unit in isolation and stub/mock everything around it. 

  * The tests are found next to the actual unit in a file with `_test.go` suffix, eg. `sha256_test.go` sitting next to `sha256.go`

## Developer experience

### IDE

* We recommend working on the project with [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) IDE. Recommended settings:
  * Under `Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Go` make sure `Use tab character` is checked

* For easy testing, under `Run | Edit Configurations` add these `Go Test` configurations:
  * "Fast" with `Directory` set to project root and `-short` flag added to `Go tool arguments`
  * "All" with `Directory` set to project root
  * It's also recommended to hide ignored tests in the test panel after running the configuration

* You may enable the following automatic tools that run on file changes:
  * "go fmt" in `Preferences | Tools | File Watchers`, add with `+` the `go fmt` watcher
  * "go test" in `Preferences | Tools | File Watchers`, add with `+` a `custom` watcher:
    * Name: `go test`, File type: `Go`, Scope: `Project Files`
    * Program: `$GoExecPath$`, Arguments: `test -short ./...`, Working directory: `$ProjectFileDir$`
